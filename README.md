# Shockflo40A EVSE Project
Re-imagining the firmware for a 40A Shockflo CG04 EV charger, as found for roughly $55 on eBay in September of 2025.

My specific goal with this, is to make the charger able to be dynamically throttled/controlled to only offload excess power into a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.  Basically plug the car in, and forget about it--if there's any extra power, it will be gated into the PHEV.

A lot of programming will be required.

NOTE: I will NOT upload the original GD32 firmware binary here.  All firmware work will be done from the ground up.
